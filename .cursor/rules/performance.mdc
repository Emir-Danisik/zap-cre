# Performance Guidelines

## Core Web Vitals
- Target Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) < 2.5s
- Target First Input Delay (FID) < 100ms
- Target Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) < 0.1

## Server Components
- Utilize Next.js server components to reduce client-side JavaScript
- Keep client components minimal and focused
- Use streaming where appropriate for progressive rendering

## Image Optimization
- Always use Next.js Image component
- Properly size images based on their display size
- Use modern image formats (WebP, AVIF) where supported
- Implement responsive images with appropriate srcsets

## Bundle Size
- Keep client-side bundle size minimal
- Use dynamic imports for code splitting
- Avoid large dependencies where possible
- Monitor bundle size with regular checks

## API Performance
- Implement caching strategies for API responses
- Use edge functions for geographically distributed APIs
- Monitor API response times and optimize slow endpoints
- Implement pagination for large datasets

## Data Fetching
- Use parallel data fetching where possible
- Implement stale-while-revalidate patterns for fresh data
- Consider using React Query or SWR for client-side data fetching
- Implement proper loading states for data fetching operations
