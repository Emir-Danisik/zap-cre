# Development Workflow

## Git Workflow
- Use feature branches for new features and bug fixes
- Create descriptive branch names (feature/, bugfix/, etc.)
- Keep commits small and focused
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Submit pull requests for code review before merging

## Code Review
- Review all code changes before merging
- Check for adherence to project standards
- Verify functionality works as expected
- Look for potential performance issues
- Ensure proper test coverage

## Testing
- Write tests for critical functionality
- Aim for high test coverage on core business logic
- Use Jest for unit testing
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows

## Environment Configuration
- Use .env.local for local development
- Never commit environment secrets to version control
- Document required environment variables
- Set up different environments (development, staging, production)

## Deployment
- Use Vercel for deployments
- Set up preview deployments for pull requests
- Implement automatic deployments for the main branch
- Monitor deployments for errors and performance issues

## Documentation
- Document complex business logic
- Keep README up to date with setup instructions
- Document API endpoints and their usage
- Use TypeScript JSDoc comments for function documentation
